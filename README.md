# Assignment 4

This is my project for Assignment 4.
It is about a graph with points and paths.

I used Java to do it.

## What it does

Adds points (Vertex)

Adds paths between points (Edge)

Goes through points (BFS)

Finds best path (Dijkstra)

## Files

Vertex.java

Edge.java

WeightedGraph.java

BFS.java

DijkstraSearch.java

Main.java

## How to run

1. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Run Main.java
3. You will see the result in the console

## Example output

BFS traversal:

Visited: A

Visited: B

Visited: C

Visited: D

Dijkstra distances:

To A: 0.0

To B: 4.0

To C: 2.0

To D: 5.0
